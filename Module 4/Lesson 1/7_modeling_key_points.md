# Modeling, Key Points

Neural networks are the basis for many of the ML that we see today. This networks consist of nodes which are connected together by inputs and outputs. The input weights of each node are tuned and eventually determine the behavior of the data flowing through the network. There are various types of nodes and networks focusing in particular applications.
