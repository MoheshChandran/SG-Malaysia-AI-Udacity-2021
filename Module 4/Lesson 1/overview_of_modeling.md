# Overview of Modeling

Modeling and machine learning consists of constructing the core components that will serve as the framework for a machine learning model. neural networks are some of the most common models used in ml. A neural network is a series of layers each of which contains different nodes which will perform various calculations. The structure of these layers as well as how they're connected is what is known as the architecture of the network. There is a process known as neural architecture search that further optimizes the creation of a neural network.
